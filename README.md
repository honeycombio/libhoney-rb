# libhoney [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/honeycombio/libhoney-rb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/honeycombio/libhoney-rb) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/libhoney.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/libhoney)

Ruby gem for sending events to [Honeycomb](https://honeycomb.io). (For more information, see the [documentation](https://honeycomb.io/docs/) and [Ruby SDK guide](https://honeycomb.io/docs/connect/ruby).)

## Installation

To install the stable release:

```
gem install libhoney
```

or add `libhoney` to your Gemfile:

```
gem 'libhoney'
# or, to follow the bleeding edge:
#gem 'libhoney', git: 'https://github.com/honeycombio/libhoney-rb.git'
```

This gem has some native dependencies, so if you see an error along the lines of "Failed to build gem native extension", you may need to install the Ruby development headers and a C++ compiler. e.g. on Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential ruby-dev
```

Note that libhoney requires Ruby 2.2 or greater.


## Documentation

An API reference is available at http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/libhoney

## Example Usage

Honeycomb can calculate all sorts of statistics, so send the values you care about and let us crunch the averages, percentiles, lower/upper bounds, cardinality -- whatever you want -- for you.

```ruby
require 'libhoney'

# Create a client instance
honeycomb = Libhoney::Client.new(
  # Use an environment variable to set your write key with something like
  #   `:writekey => ENV["HONEYCOMB_WRITEKEY"]`
  :writekey =>  "YOUR_WRITE_KEY",
  :dataset => "honeycomb-ruby-example"
)

honeycomb.send_now({
  duration_ms: 153.12,
  method: "get",
  hostname: "appserver15",
  payload_length: 27
})

# Call close to flush any pending calls to Honeycomb
honeycomb.close
```

You can find a more complete example demonstrating usage in [`example/fact.rb`](example/fact.rb)
