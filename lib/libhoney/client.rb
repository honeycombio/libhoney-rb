module Libhoney
  ##
  # This is a library to allow you to send events to Honeycomb from within your
  # Ruby application.
  #
  # @example Send a simple event
  #   require 'libhoney'
  #   honey = Libhoney.new(writekey, dataset, sample_rate)
  #
  #   evt = honey.event
  #   evt.add(pglatency: 100)
  #   honey.send(evt)
  #
  #   # repeat creating and sending events until your program is finished
  #
  #   honey.close
  #
  # @example Override the default timestamp on an event
  #   one_hour_ago = Time.now - 3600
  #
  #   evt = libhoney.event
  #   evt.add_fields(useful_fields)
  #   evt.timestamp = one_hour_ago
  #   evt.send

    #   a 1-in-10 chance of it being successfully emitted to Honeycomb, and the
    #   Honeycomb query engine will interpret it as representative of 10 events)

    #   destination for these Honeycomb events.
